1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:08.950
you

2
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.440
hi Thomas from Phil Jenny's the service

3
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.150
the most complex stroke in tennis and

4
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.040
that's why it's the most difficult one

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.500
to master so if you want to build a

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.320
proper advanced tennis serve meaning

7
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.570
you're using a continental grip and

8
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.730
you're able to hit the ball with topspin

9
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.700
slice or hit it flat then you have to

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.250
follow proper progressions in order to

11
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.450
build technically correct advanced serve

12
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.010
the following video is an overview of

13
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.680
the fundamentals of a tennis serve and I

14
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.420
will show you seven step-by-step

15
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.609
progressions that I use almost daily

16
00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.800
with tennis players who come and see me

17
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.199
to work on the tennis serve most of the

18
00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:49.879
times I don't really have to go deep

19
00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.149
into the details of a serve but I just

20
00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.530
have to make sure that these

21
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.989
fundamentals are in place first and then

22
00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.019
the serve will start to work the first

23
00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.089
step is a proper stance so for right

24
00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.970
handers position yourself in a way so

25
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.740
that your left foot is pointing to the

26
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.380
right net post and that your right foot

27
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.170
is parallel to the baseline the feet are

28
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.120
also aligned in a way so that the heel

29
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.370
of the first foot is aligned with the

30
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.190
toes of the back foot now this is the

31
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.350
basic stance which you can then adjust a

32
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.630
little bit depending on which direction

33
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.090
you're serving to and I also want to

34
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.860
point out that I really recommend it

35
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.960
when you start building your serve you

36
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.360
do it in the direction of the Edward and

37
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.140
I'll explain in more detail why that's

38
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.330
necessary when we come to the heating

39
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.390
part of the serve the second step is a

40
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.100
proper grip and we have to use a

41
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.320
continental grip if we want to hit the

42
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.590
surf flat with topspin or with slice one

43
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.500
way to find a continental grip is to

44
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.480
position your hand on the racket in a

45
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.450
way so that once you put your left index

46
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.000
finger here in this little valley next

47
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.580
to the bone or your thumb that this left

48
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.070
index finger is pointing to the top left

49
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.959
edge on the racket like this

50
00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.310
step three is the heating part and

51
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.200
that's the most important part of the

52
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.420
serve and I actually like to work on

53
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.430
these parts before I start working on

54
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.620
the backswing because you will realize

55
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.480
later that if you're doing the heating

56
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.670
part correctly the backswing will

57
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.440
naturally align and help you achieve

58
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.690
what you want to do here so that's why

59
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.599
the heating part is more important than

60
00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.840
doing the backswing first one of the

61
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.549
most common mistakes that players make

62
00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.829
even when they hold the Continental grip

63
00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.859
and even if they have a proper stance is

64
00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.560
that once they begin their serve they

65
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.750
start to orient very quickly towards the

66
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.180
court and then they swing towards the

67
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.609
target with their whole arm I know

68
00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.409
that's the most natural for us but

69
00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.599
that's not how an advanced serve works

70
00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.239
so their usual serve looks something

71
00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.799
like this so they turn towards the

72
00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.200
target they go very strongly from their

73
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.450
shoulder and they usually finish on

74
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.079
their left and so in order for me to

75
00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.389
correct these players I use a very

76
00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.370
simple system which teaches them that

77
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.730
the serve has instead of one swing path

78
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.730
towards the target it actually has two

79
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.549
swing pass so the first swing path is

80
00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.370
roughly at a 45 degree angle and then

81
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.290
the second one is perpendicular to the

82
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.900
net and this is how we simulate the

83
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.780
proper movement of the arm so when we

84
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.660
toss the ball for the normal usual serve

85
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.280
for the flat serve or maybe for this

86
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.519
slice serve the ball is somewhere in

87
00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.500
front of us and a little bit to the

88
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.660
right and so our first swing path

89
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.480
towards the ball is with the edge so

90
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.160
we're swinging towards the ball with the

91
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.190
edge at the 45 degree angle and then we

92
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.260
can imagine that once the racket reaches

93
00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.970
the ball and the strings are pointing

94
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.310
towards the target we switch our

95
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.680
movements to this one and so it's not

96
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.829
just one continuous movement but we

97
00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.639
imagine that our arm moves this way at a

98
00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.400
roughly 45 degree angle and then we

99
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.949
pronate towards the target at least we

100
00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.440
can simplify and make this movement of

101
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.019
pronation it's a little bit more complex

102
00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.669
movement but for now we'll just call it

103
00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.889
the pronation so our service

104
00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.469
Swink towards the ball and then

105
00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:29.659
pronation and it looks something like

106
00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:39.759
this in this third part

107
00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.099
and so this is the main difference

108
00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.339
between a very simple serve towards the

109
00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:48.099
target and a more advanced serve where

110
00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.089
our arm makes to swing pass of course

111
00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:54.159
later we do it in a very smooth manner

112
00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:57.610
and these two swing paths seem to merge

113
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.249
together but if you're serving correctly

114
00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:03.009
or pretty aware that you are swinging

115
00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.870
like in two directions towards the ball

116
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.129
because we are now breaking down the

117
00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:11.199
serve into smaller parts so that they

118
00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.300
are easier to learn we are unfortunately

119
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.149
also breaking down the natural flow of

120
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.809
the body and so as this is especially

121
00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:21.669
obvious in this part where we're trying

122
00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.460
to learn the proper swing path towards

123
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.599
the ball and one way we can solve this

124
00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.169
problem is that when we're starting to

125
00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.059
serve from this position we don't start

126
00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:36.939
from a static position but we do a

127
00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:38.740
little bounce as I like to call it

128
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.779
so we you can bounce the racquet a

129
00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:42.819
little bit like this and then go from

130
00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.509
this bounce into swing path number one

131
00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.060
and then swing path number two so the

132
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.919
whole exercise looks something like this

133
00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.539
I just want to loosen up a little bit

134
00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.169
and then I do one two on the ball

135
00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:05.759
here's one more

136
00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:11.309
a little bit more advanced way of doing

137
00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:14.279
this exercise is to actually try and do

138
00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.529
the bounce one more bounce

139
00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:19.259
after you have tossed the ball so it

140
00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.430
looks something like this so I start

141
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.009
with my racket a little bit higher so

142
00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:28.110
that I feel that I have some space to

143
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.749
drop the racket or to bounce it off

144
00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:32.999
something so my hand my arm is very

145
00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:35.219
loose so I start from here I toss the

146
00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:37.409
ball first and after I toss the ball I

147
00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:40.199
release I let go of the racket I feel

148
00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:51.390
this bounce and then I'm doing one two

149
00:06:51.390 --> 00:07:02.380
you

150
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.420
now this has shown to be very effective

151
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.420
for learning the proper drop of the surf

152
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.730
later when you're going to put the whole

153
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.040
surf together if you've done a few of

154
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.530
these bosses it will just happen very

155
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.780
naturally that you're doing the proper

156
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.140
drop in the surf step four is the

157
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.090
backswing with the toss I won't go into

158
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.730
too many details about the toss so for

159
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.850
now just this so place the ball right in

160
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.920
the middle of your palm and then just

161
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.690
hold it with your thumb and you're

162
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.150
leaving some space on the tips of your

163
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.280
fingers where you're going to place your

164
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.470
racket so also know that you're tossing

165
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.860
with a straight arm so for those of you

166
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.630
who would like to know more details

167
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.000
about the toss you can take a look into

168
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.550
my surf course here's how we're going to

169
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.170
work on the backswing you're going to

170
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.170
swing both arms simultaneously like a

171
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.300
pendulum and let them go up and down

172
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.890
simultaneously and eventually you're

173
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.050
going to end up in this position which

174
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.490
we're going to call the trophy position

175
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.940
I personally don't like to teach the

176
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.800
completely vertical racquet in the

177
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.900
trophy position and that's for two

178
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.020
reasons number one oftentimes when

179
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.270
players end up in this position and

180
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.770
they're about to initiate their serve

181
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.140
the racket really likes to fall into

182
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.140
this direction and open up the palm of

183
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.600
the hand which we call the waiters tray

184
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.390
serve and that's really bad for the

185
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.430
acceleration so it really doesn't give

186
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.740
you a good acceleration on the ball and

187
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.860
it prevents good topspin and good slice

188
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.419
so if you're in this position many times

189
00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:42.080
the racket wants to go this way and the

190
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.270
other reason is if I show from this

191
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.730
angle when players toss the ball and

192
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.560
they're in this position like very

193
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.810
vertical racket they feel they have a

194
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.540
long way to go to complete their draw up

195
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.000
their backswing and then coming up to

196
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.550
the ball so what happens oftentimes is

197
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.140
they shorten it they make it quite

198
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.450
shallow and they serve like this so the

199
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.180
drop is way too shallow because they

200
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.640
feel they don't have enough time so what

201
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.190
I prefer to do is I prefer to teach this

202
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.010
trophy position where the racquet is

203
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.630
close to the head

204
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.069
so one way you can check that is that

205
00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:21.199
you do your backswing and then you just

206
00:09:21.199 --> 00:09:23.449
tap the back of your head with the

207
00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:26.480
bottom edge of the racket so you're

208
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.430
hearing of course there must be some

209
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.050
space between the racket and the head

210
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.690
but in order for you to know whether in

211
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.220
the right place you just move the racket

212
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.990
this way and you check ok I'm in the

213
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.019
right place then you move it back so

214
00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:41.600
this is the backs the backswing sequence

215
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.779
you're going to toss the ball and catch

216
00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:46.610
it back again and then check if your

217
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.220
racket is in the right place now this

218
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.980
exercise is also very good to work on

219
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.579
your toes so you don't need any specific

220
00:09:54.579 --> 00:09:56.750
exercises for the toss unless you're

221
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.509
having some really big problems because

222
00:09:59.509 --> 00:10:02.720
this exercise is automatically teaching

223
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.420
you how to move your arm properly and

224
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.819
where to toss the ball because the ball

225
00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:11.480
must fall right back into your hand so

226
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.360
here's the backswing sequence again you

227
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.310
want to toss the ball and they'll just

228
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.810
check with your racket if you're

229
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.380
somewhere close to your head step 5 is

230
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.060
putting everything together what you've

231
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.560
learned so far so we're going to put

232
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.540
together the backswing and the hitting

233
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.880
part and so we're going to break down

234
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.529
the serving into two parts the first

235
00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:34.160
part is doing the backswing and catching

236
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:34.779
the ball

237
00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:37.160
finding your trophy position and then

238
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.360
you're going to remain in your trophy

239
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.790
position you will initiate the toss

240
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.250
again and then you're going to do the 1

241
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.040
2 exercise so the bouncing want to

242
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.839
exercise which you've already done

243
00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:50.420
before so the whole sequence looks like

244
00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.149
this we're doing the back swing we're

245
00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:54.829
catching the ball we're checking if

246
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:57.259
you're in the right position then we're

247
00:10:57.259 --> 00:11:00.470
going to toss again and do once to again

248
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.300
so that's why we can still leave the

249
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.670
balls because they give us proper

250
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.730
guidance of the to sweep paths so here's

251
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.779
one more example part 1 I'm in the right

252
00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:14.259
place I can feel and I start again and

253
00:11:14.259 --> 00:11:17.660
I'm doing 1 2 so hopefully you can see

254
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.269
that this is starting to resemble the

255
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:23.420
proper serve so here we go again

256
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:28.140
the first part I check I do the bounce

257
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:32.190
and one two now we're almost ready to

258
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.290
put the whole surf together but before

259
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.480
we do that I'd like you to work on one

260
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.240
exercise that actually produces the most

261
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.340
power in the surf and for that you have

262
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.730
to do two things simultaneously so what

263
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.310
needs to happen is that when your racket

264
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.550
is starting to drop your body must start

265
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.730
to turn or in other words we initiate

266
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.860
the rotation of the body to our hips and

267
00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.010
then continue with our shoulders so some

268
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.230
words that you might hear that they

269
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.720
relate to these are drive with your hip

270
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.300
forward or rotate your hip or rotate

271
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.910
your shoulders but it's very important

272
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.340
that this happens at the same time so

273
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.250
your racket drop and your body rotation

274
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.460
must happen in the same time I know we

275
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.430
like to have things step by step or in

276
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.710
sequence that are very clear but in this

277
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.500
case we cannot separate the drop from

278
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.870
the body rotation which is again one of

279
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.210
very common mistakes that I see with

280
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.950
players so they're completing the drop

281
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.990
they want to work in sequence in their

282
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.480
mind they have a certain sequence so now

283
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.340
I complete the drop okay now I'm doing

284
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.040
the serve but in order for yourself to

285
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.280
produce very effortless power you must

286
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.700
simultaneously drop the racket and start

287
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.560
driving your hip forward or start

288
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.560
rotating so you're actually doing this

289
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.650
exercise separately and I'll show from

290
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.570
this angle and first you're doing

291
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.550
without the ball and you're just trying

292
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.710
to feel that as soon as you start

293
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.080
dropping the racket you are start

294
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.080
driving your hip forward so in this case

295
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.790
you can exaggerate a little bit and

296
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.520
rotate your body a little bit more then

297
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.820
you will actually do when you're serving

298
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.170
but this gives you the right feel

299
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.320
because when you do it right you will

300
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.900
just feel that your racket naturally

301
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.390
accelerate or you might feel that your

302
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.870
arm is like thrown out from this

303
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.660
position so again is the key is that as

304
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.030
you're starting your drop you're

305
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.130
loosening up your arm and you're

306
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.300
starting to turn

307
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.820
your body so from this angle it looks

308
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.070
something like this

309
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.390
looks something like this and then you

310
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.240
can continue or from this angle it looks

311
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:55.279
something like this

312
00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:58.350
you

313
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.260
and here's the power move from the side

314
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.600
angle so first without the ball you're

315
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.550
starting from your trophy position and

316
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.800
you're trying to feel okay as soon as I

317
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.070
drop my racket I drive forward my hip

318
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.810
and so you go like this and then you can

319
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.960
just complete your serve so in this case

320
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.000
because we want to really feel what's

321
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.790
going on we can exaggerate a little bit

322
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.730
and you can turn really forward like

323
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.430
facing the court but keep in mind that

324
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.010
when you're doing a proper serve we

325
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.230
don't face the court until we finish

326
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.140
hitting the ball so when we're hitting

327
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.190
the ball we are at roughly 45 degree

328
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.350
angle with the body we are not facing

329
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:47.130
the court yet and only then after we

330
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.410
have completed the contact with the ball

331
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.180
and we've completed the swing path

332
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.900
number two we can start turning towards

333
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.200
the court but in this case because you

334
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.620
really want to feel the effects of

335
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.730
simultaneously dropping the racket and

336
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.860
turning your body just feel free to

337
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.720
really turn towards the court really

338
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.690
drive your hip forward really rotate and

339
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.410
then let the racket go so again without

340
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.270
the ball it's like this and then you can

341
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.510
also hit some balls where you start

342
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.000
trying to feel the effects of the power

343
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:29.439
move

344
00:15:29.439 --> 00:15:31.759
step seven is of course putting

345
00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:34.009
everything together so what you can do

346
00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:35.899
first is you can do one serving two

347
00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:39.769
parts where you really feel it how the

348
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:43.220
serve works and then just take a leap of

349
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.579
faith and do the whole serve together

350
00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:49.189
and see how it feels so with some

351
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:51.500
repetition and practice and I also

352
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.209
recommend that you record yourself

353
00:15:53.209 --> 00:15:55.459
you're going to start to see that your

354
00:15:55.459 --> 00:15:57.290
serve starts to look like a proper

355
00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.139
advance serve now one more thought about

356
00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:04.100
the follow-through I've been sticking

357
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.720
with this follow through for quite a

358
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.230
while because as I mentioned before one

359
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.879
of the most common mistakes that players

360
00:16:10.879 --> 00:16:13.459
make is to use their arm a lot rather

361
00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:16.040
than this move to hit the ball and they

362
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.040
oftentimes end up on the left side so

363
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.199
yes we do end up on the left side so let

364
00:16:21.199 --> 00:16:23.329
me show from this angle so when we

365
00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:25.250
complete our serve we do end up on the

366
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.529
left side but we can do it the wrong way

367
00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.870
and the right way the wrong way is that

368
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.600
as we're about to hit the ball we are

369
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.120
forcefully moving the racket to the left

370
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.670
side with our shoulder but that's not

371
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.160
how the racket gets to the left side it

372
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.990
actually gets to the left side because

373
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.540
we're hitting the servant we're swinging

374
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.839
out towards the right side we're

375
00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:50.000
pronating and then we're allowing the

376
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.449
body to uncoil or to unwind and our arm

377
00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:55.430
will naturally swing to the left

378
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.430
so basically we're swinging arm towards

379
00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:02.180
more to the right side and then we are

380
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.010
coming back with the body towards the

381
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.890
middle we're loosening up and that's how

382
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.380
the arm comes to the left side so keep

383
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.059
that in mind when you're working on the

384
00:17:11.059 --> 00:17:13.130
serve when you're completing the whole

385
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.620
serve that you feel that the racket

386
00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.020
actually comes to the left side as you

387
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.630
loosen up and not because you're

388
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.699
actually swinging very forcefully from

389
00:17:22.699 --> 00:17:25.890
your shoulder towards the left side

390
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.530
so try to see this in my serve where I

391
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.040
will stick for a while on the right side

392
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.570
so I'll complete the serve on the right

393
00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.450
side and I will just gently allow my

394
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.610
body to come back to the straight

395
00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:41.370
position that my shoulders become more

396
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.350
level and then you will see that the

397
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.260
racket naturally swings to my left side

398
00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.179
so in my serve this is a little bit

399
00:17:48.179 --> 00:17:59.120
hidden when you see everything together

400
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.290
but now that you know what you're

401
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.620
looking for you will understand how the

402
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.570
racket comes to the left side of the

403
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:10.290
body now there's one more part that you

404
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.330
have to work on as you're improving your

405
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.059
serve namely you have to work on the

406
00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:17.820
flow on the fluidity of the serve right

407
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.130
now we have broken down the serve into

408
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.960
many parts so that they're easier to

409
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.510
learn but in the process we have also

410
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.730
broken down the natural movement of the

411
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.010
body we have broken down the flow the

412
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.410
fluidity and so we have to keep putting

413
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.990
it back together and so one of the best

414
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.960
tools you can use is the serve master by

415
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.540
Lisa Dotson and you just simply swing it

416
00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.210
in a continuous motion like this so you

417
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.040
can do follow-through on the left side

418
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.080
but you can also do follow-through on

419
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.190
the right side and if you go over to the

420
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.190
total serve com you will find very

421
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.929
detailed instructions on how you can

422
00:18:57.929 --> 00:19:01.200
start working with the serve master what

423
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.960
are the right progressions but the key

424
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.450
point is that you want to re-establish

425
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.700
the fluidity of your body the fluidity

426
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.309
of your motion because we have been

427
00:19:11.309 --> 00:19:13.590
breaking it down and especially when you

428
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.230
work on yourself repeatedly and there

429
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.000
are certain parts of your serve that are

430
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.080
not really good

431
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.360
perhaps the heating part so again you'll

432
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.130
be breaking down your serve into a

433
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.770
smaller part and it might become very

434
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.679
stiff very mechanical and so your final

435
00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:31.950
goal is to polish these little breaks in

436
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.510
your serve so that everything is

437
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.179
smoothly flowing and so one of the best

438
00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:39.330
ways is the total serve using the total

439
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.210
serve you can of course use also the

440
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.410
ball on the string that I've

441
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.540
demonstrated one time before or the

442
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.900
classical trick balls in the sock but

443
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.620
you can also use your racket which you

444
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.470
hold with three fingers and again you

445
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.520
just make it go in a very similar manner

446
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.890
so in a very continuous smooth motion

447
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.620
that never stops so that means that you

448
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.960
reestablish the flow because flow means

449
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.570
that the racket never stops so while

450
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.700
you're doing this exercise you

451
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.230
and also do a little technical thing

452
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:16.230
here and that is you're always swinging

453
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.809
your racket on the edge so this is the

454
00:20:18.809 --> 00:20:21.779
edges exercise that I also demonstrated

455
00:20:21.779 --> 00:20:24.480
in one of my previous videos so as

456
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.159
you're doing this exercise you always

457
00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:29.639
lead with the edge so when I swing this

458
00:20:29.639 --> 00:20:32.399
way I lead with this edge and then I'm

459
00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:34.139
doing my back swing I'm coming from the

460
00:20:34.139 --> 00:20:36.000
trophy position into the drop I'm

461
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.549
leading with this edge then I rotate my

462
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:41.159
shoulders a little bit now I lead with

463
00:20:41.159 --> 00:20:44.639
this edge then I do this transition from

464
00:20:44.639 --> 00:20:47.370
this edge to this edge and then I go

465
00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.590
into the follow-through then I go out

466
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.870
and I repeat the whole process again so

467
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:54.870
see if you can notice now that all the

468
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.570
time as I'm swinging except at the

469
00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.299
context point where my racquet points

470
00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:02.970
towards the camera or towards you all

471
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.450
the time the racket is on the edge and

472
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.419
so that's a very good exercise to

473
00:21:09.419 --> 00:21:12.090
reinforce the proper technique the

474
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:16.289
proper movement of the racket in the end

475
00:21:16.289 --> 00:21:18.360
I'd like to point out that I use these

476
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.760
serving progressions these fundamentals

477
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.710
almost daily when I work with tennis

478
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.990
players on their serve so make sure that

479
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.179
you can execute them properly that

480
00:21:27.179 --> 00:21:29.399
you're doing them correctly before you

481
00:21:29.399 --> 00:21:31.590
start adding more advanced stuff like

482
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.100
really coiling your body working on your

483
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.529
kick serve jumping into the court or

484
00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:40.139
something like that thanks for watching

485
00:21:40.139 --> 00:21:42.480
and let me know how these seven steps to

486
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.549
a proper advance serve work for you
