Dialogue: 2,0:02:39.82,0:02:42.85,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}and even if they have a proper stance is
Dialogue: 2,0:02:42.85,0:02:45.56,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}that once they begin their serve they
Dialogue: 2,0:02:45.56,0:02:47.75,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}start to orient very quickly towards the
Dialogue: 2,0:02:47.75,0:02:50.18,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}court and then they swing towards the
Dialogue: 2,0:02:50.18,0:02:52.60,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}target with their whole arm I know
Dialogue: 2,0:02:52.60,0:02:54.40,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}that's the most natural for us but
Dialogue: 2,0:02:54.40,0:02:56.59,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}that's not how an advanced serve works
Dialogue: 2,0:02:56.59,0:02:59.23,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}so their usual serve looks something
Dialogue: 2,0:02:59.23,0:03:02.79,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}like this so they turn towards the
Dialogue: 2,0:03:02.79,0:03:06.20,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}target they go very strongly from their
Dialogue: 2,0:03:06.20,0:03:08.45,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}shoulder and they usually finish on
Dialogue: 2,0:03:08.45,0:03:12.07,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}their left and so in order for me to
Dialogue: 2,0:03:12.07,0:03:14.38,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}correct these players I use a very
Dialogue: 2,0:03:14.38,0:03:16.37,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}simple system which teaches them that
Dialogue: 2,0:03:16.37,0:03:19.73,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}the serve has instead of one swing path
Dialogue: 2,0:03:19.73,0:03:22.73,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}towards the target it actually has two
Dialogue: 2,0:03:22.73,0:03:25.54,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}swing pass so the first swing path is
Dialogue: 2,0:03:25.54,0:03:28.37,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}roughly at a 45 degree angle and then
Dialogue: 2,0:03:28.37,0:03:30.29,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}the second one is perpendicular to the
Dialogue: 2,0:03:30.29,0:03:32.90,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}net and this is how we simulate the
Dialogue: 2,0:03:32.90,0:03:35.78,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}proper movement of the arm so when we
Dialogue: 2,0:03:35.78,0:03:38.66,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}toss the ball for the normal usual serve
Dialogue: 2,0:03:38.66,0:03:40.28,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}for the flat serve or maybe for this
Dialogue: 2,0:03:40.28,0:03:43.51,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}slice serve the ball is somewhere in
Dialogue: 2,0:03:43.51,0:03:45.50,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}front of us and a little bit to the
Dialogue: 2,0:03:45.50,0:03:47.66,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}right and so our first swing path
Dialogue: 2,0:03:47.66,0:03:50.48,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}towards the ball is with the edge so
Dialogue: 2,0:03:50.48,0:03:52.16,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}we're swinging towards the ball with the
Dialogue: 2,0:03:52.16,0:03:55.19,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}edge at the 45 degree angle and then we
Dialogue: 2,0:03:55.19,0:03:57.26,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}can imagine that once the racket reaches
Dialogue: 2,0:03:57.26,0:03:58.97,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}the ball and the strings are pointing
Dialogue: 2,0:03:58.97,0:04:01.31,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}towards the target we switch our
Dialogue: 2,0:04:01.31,0:04:03.68,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}movements to this one and so it's not
Dialogue: 2,0:04:03.68,0:04:06.82,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}just one continuous movement but we
Dialogue: 2,0:04:06.82,0:04:09.63,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}imagine that our arm moves this way at a
Dialogue: 2,0:04:09.63,0:04:13.40,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}roughly 45 degree angle and then we
Dialogue: 2,0:04:13.40,0:04:15.94,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}pronate towards the target at least we
Dialogue: 2,0:04:15.94,0:04:18.44,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}can simplify and make this movement of
Dialogue: 2,0:04:18.44,0:04:21.01,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}pronation it's a little bit more complex
Dialogue: 2,0:04:21.01,0:04:22.66,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}movement but for now we'll just call it
Dialogue: 2,0:04:22.66,0:04:24.88,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}the pronation so our service
Dialogue: 2,0:04:24.88,0:04:27.46,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}Swink towards the ball and then
Dialogue: 2,0:04:27.46,0:04:29.65,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}pronation and it looks something like
Dialogue: 2,0:04:29.65,0:04:39.75,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}this in this third part
Dialogue: 2,0:04:39.75,0:04:42.09,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}and so this is the main difference
Dialogue: 2,0:04:42.09,0:04:45.33,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}between a very simple serve towards the
Dialogue: 2,0:04:45.33,0:04:48.09,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}target and a more advanced serve where
Dialogue: 2,0:04:48.09,0:04:52.08,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}our arm makes to swing pass of course
Dialogue: 2,0:04:52.08,0:04:54.15,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}later we do it in a very smooth manner
Dialogue: 2,0:04:54.15,0:04:57.61,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}and these two swing paths seem to merge
Dialogue: 2,0:04:57.61,0:05:00.24,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}together but if you're serving correctly
Dialogue: 2,0:05:00.24,0:05:03.00,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}or pretty aware that you are swinging
Dialogue: 2,0:05:03.00,0:05:06.87,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}like in two directions towards the ball
Dialogue: 2,0:05:06.87,0:05:09.12,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}because we are now breaking down the
Dialogue: 2,0:05:09.12,0:05:11.19,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}serve into smaller parts so that they
Dialogue: 2,0:05:11.19,0:05:13.30,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}are easier to learn we are unfortunately
Dialogue: 2,0:05:13.30,0:05:16.14,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}also breaking down the natural flow of
Dialogue: 2,0:05:16.14,0:05:19.80,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}the body and so as this is especially
Dialogue: 2,0:05:19.80,0:05:21.66,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}obvious in this part where we're trying
Dialogue: 2,0:05:21.66,0:05:24.46,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}to learn the proper swing path towards
Dialogue: 2,0:05:24.46,0:05:28.59,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}the ball and one way we can solve this
Dialogue: 2,0:05:28.59,0:05:32.16,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}problem is that when we're starting to
Dialogue: 2,0:05:32.16,0:05:34.05,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}serve from this position we don't start
Dialogue: 2,0:05:34.05,0:05:36.93,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}from a static position but we do a
Dialogue: 2,0:05:36.93,0:05:38.74,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}little bounce as I like to call it
Dialogue: 2,0:05:38.74,0:05:40.77,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}so we you can bounce the racquet a
Dialogue: 2,0:05:40.77,0:05:42.81,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}little bit like this and then go from
Dialogue: 2,0:05:42.81,0:05:46.50,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}this bounce into swing path number one
Dialogue: 2,0:05:46.50,0:05:49.06,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}and then swing path number two so the
Dialogue: 2,0:05:49.06,0:05:50.91,Default-Copy,,0,0,0,,{\fad(200,200)}whole exercise looks something like this
